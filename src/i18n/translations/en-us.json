I designed the architecture, brought it to the team for discussion and then developed the solution. In the period of 1 year, 17 thousand proposals were formalized thanks to the reminders. Technologies involved: TypeScript, NodeJS, Java, Apache Kafka, AWS Lambda, AWS ECS, AWS EventBridge Scheduler, AWS SNS, AWS SQS, AWS DynamoDB.<br/><strong>Project 2</strong>: Extract insurance proposal data from our database and save it in a partitioned S3 bucket so that the data and analytics team can perform SQL queries in Amazon Athena. The result of this project is the democratization of data and the possibility of discovering new insights about the business. Technologies involved: AWS DynamoDB, DynamoDB Streams, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS EventBridge Scheduler, AWS Glue, Apache Spark, Python, Terraform, CI/CD, Grafana, Prometheus.<br/><strong>Project 3</strong>: Enable the squad to test new things in the development environment. The context of this problem is that we can only test new things after moving them to the staging environment, and this is not ideal. My job was to review the squad's entire microservices architecture and put together a plan to adjust all applications and make them work in the development environment. The result of this project was an increase in the squad's productivity as it was able to iterate faster on new developments."
