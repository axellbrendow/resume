The approach was based on scheduled reminders. I designed the architecture, brought it to the team for discussion and developed the solution. In the period of 1 year, 17 thousand proposals were formalized thanks to the reminders. Technologies: TypeScript, NodeJS, Java, Apache Kafka, AWS DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, AWS ECS, AWS EventBridge Scheduler, AWS SNS, AWS SQS.<br/><strong>Project 2</strong>: Extract insurance proposal data from our database and save it in a partitioned S3 bucket so that the data and analytics team can perform SQL queries in Amazon Athena. The result of this project is the democratization of data and the possibility of discovering new insights about the business. Technologies: AWS DynamoDB, DynamoDB Streams, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS EventBridge Scheduler, AWS Glue, Apache Spark, Python, Terraform, CI/CD, Grafana, Prometheus.<br/><strong>Project 3</strong>: Enable my team to test new things in the development environment. The context of this problem is that we could only test things after deploying them in a staging environment, and this is not ideal. My job was to review the team's entire microservices architecture and put together a plan to adjust all applications and make them work in the development environment. The result of this project was an increase in the team's productivity as it was able to iterate faster on new developments."
